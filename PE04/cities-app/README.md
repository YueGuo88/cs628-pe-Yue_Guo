Input
The program "Cities" operates based on user input and follows the Input-Process-Output model. The user interacts with the application through various forms and clicks, providing input in the form of city details. Input includes data such as city names, ages, and other information submitted through the "Add City" form.

Process
Once the user submits the input, the program processes this information to manage city data. The data is structured, stored, and manipulated as needed. The React Router library handles routing, enabling navigation between different sections of the application. The useParams hook extracts the unique city identifier from the URL, allowing the program to fetch the corresponding city's details. Redirection is also implemented, ensuring smooth navigation after adding a city.

Output
The output of the program encompasses the visual representation of the processed data. The "Cities List" displays the names of cities as clickable links, leading to the "City Details" page. Upon clicking a city link, users are presented with detailed information about the selected city. Additionally, after successfully adding a city, users are redirected to the "Cities List" page, confirming the addition.

In summary, the program follows a clear Input-Process-Output model, where user input triggers data processing, and the resulting output is displayed through a structured interface, enhancing the user's interaction with city information.
