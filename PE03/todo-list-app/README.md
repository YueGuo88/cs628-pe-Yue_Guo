Summary of PE03:
The "To Do List App" program follows the Input-Process-Output (IPO) model, which efficiently explains how the program operates.

Input:
Under the "Input" section, users interact with the application to input their To-Do descriptions through an input field. The user-provided text is captured and processed as the task input.

Process:
The "Process" section elucidates the internal logic of the program. Upon clicking the "Add Task" button, the user's input is validated to ensure it is not empty. Valid tasks are added to the ToDo list maintained using the useState hook. Additionally, each task is assigned a "Delete" button for removal, facilitated by event handlers.

Output:
The "Output" section clarifies the results presented to the users. The ToDo list is dynamically rendered based on the current state, displaying the added tasks with proper spacing between the task names and delete buttons.

By employing the IPO model, this README.md provides a structured understanding of how the "To Do List App" functions in terms of its input handling, internal processing, and final output presentation.
